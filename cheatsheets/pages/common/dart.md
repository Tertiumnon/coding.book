# Dart

Dart is a general-purpose programming language originally developed by Google and later approved as a standard by Ecma (ECMA-408). It is used to build web, server and mobile applications, and for Internet of Things (IoT) devices.

The next generation of Google AdWords is built in Dart. 

Whether you’re creating a mobile app, web app, command-line script, or server, there’s a Dart solution for that.

Dart is an object-oriented, class defined, single inheritance language using a C-style syntax that transcompiles optionally into JavaScript. It supports interfaces, mixins, abstract classes, reified generics, static typing and a sound type system.

```dart
printInteger(int aNumber) {
  print('The number is $aNumber.'); // Print to console.
}

// This is where the app starts executing.
main() {
  var number = 42; // Declare and initialize a variable.
  printInteger(number); // Call a function.
}
```
